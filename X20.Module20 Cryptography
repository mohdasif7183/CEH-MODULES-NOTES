Clear text / Plaintext

Definition: The original readable data before any encryption.

Ciphertext

Definition: The scrambled (encrypted) data that is unreadable without the key.

Key

Definition: The secret value that controls how data is transformed for encryption and decryption.
(Note: a key is not the same as a password, although a password can be used to derive a key.)

Cipher

Definition: The algorithm (set of rules) used to encrypt and decrypt data.

Symmetric Cryptography

Definition: Same key is used for both encryption and decryption.

Fast and efficient.

Key distribution is a challenge (both parties must have the same secret).

Two kinds: stream ciphers and block ciphers.
Popular algorithms: AES, DES, 3DES, Blowfish, Twofish, RC4 (RC4 now discouraged).

Asymmetric / Public-Key Cryptography

Definition: Uses a pair of keys — a public key (shared openly) and a private key (kept secret by the owner).

Public key is used to encrypt or verify; private key is used to decrypt or sign.

Solves key distribution problems and enables digital signatures.

Provides confidentiality, integrity, authenticity and non-repudiation.
Popular algorithms: RSA, DSA, Diffie-Hellman (key exchange), ECDH / ECDSA (elliptic-curve versions).

Substitution Cipher

Definition: Each character (or unit) of plaintext is replaced with another character.
Example: Caesar cipher (shift by 3)

Plaintext : THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG
Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD
Key: right shift of 3

Transposition Cipher

Definition: The positions of plaintext units are rearranged according to a system, but the actual characters remain the same.
Example: Rail Fence cipher

(Plain characters are moved to different positions to form ciphertext.)

Polyalphabetic Cipher

Definition: A substitution cipher that uses multiple substitution alphabets (not just one).
Example: Vigenère cipher (uses a repeating key to shift letters differently at each position).

Stream Cipher

Definition: Encrypts plaintext one bit or byte at a time by combining it with a pseudorandom keystream.
Examples: RC4 (legacy), Salsa20, ChaCha20.

Block Cipher

Definition: Encrypts fixed-size blocks (groups) of bits with a symmetric key and a fixed transformation.
Examples: AES, DES, 3DES, 2DES.

Symmetric Algorithm Details
Data Encryption Standard (DES)

Introduced: 1975, standardized 1977 (NIST).

Problems: Short effective key length (56 bits) — vulnerable to brute force and ASIC attacks.

Improved version: Triple DES (applies DES three times) — more secure but slow and compute-heavy.

DES parameters

Parameter	Value
Block size	64 bits
Key size	56 bits
Rounds	16

Triple DES (3DES): Uses DES three times to increase security, but is slower.

Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

Published: late 1990s, standard 2002.

Widely used and strong (approved for high-security use).

AES parameters

Variant	Block size	Key size	Rounds
AES-128	128 bits	128 bits	10
AES-192	128 bits	192 bits	12
AES-256	128 bits	256 bits	14
Modes of Operation (for block ciphers)

ECB (Electronic Code Book): Each block encrypted independently. Simple but reveals patterns — not recommended for most use.

CBC (Cipher Block Chaining): Each plaintext block is XORed with previous ciphertext block before encryption; hides patterns, needs IV.

OFB (Output Feedback): Turns a block cipher into a synchronous stream cipher using an IV and feedback.

GCM (Galois/Counter Mode): Counter mode with built-in authentication (integrity + confidentiality). Common and recommended.

Hashing

Definition: Converts data into a fixed-length string (hash) in a one-way way — you cannot revert the hash to the original data. Used for integrity checks and storing password hashes.

Avalanche effect: Changing one bit in input drastically changes the hash.

Collision: When two different inputs produce the same hash (undesirable).

Common hashes: MD5 (weak), SHA-1 (weak), SHA-2 family (SHA-256, SHA-512 — strong), and modern password hashers like bcrypt, scrypt, PBKDF2.

Other Important Concepts (brief)
HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code)

Definition: A hash combined with a secret key to provide message integrity and authenticity.

PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) & Digital Certificates

Definition: The system (CAs, certificates, revocation) that issues and manages public key certificates (e.g., X.509) so people can trust public keys.

Digital Signature

Definition: A cryptographic signature (hash + private key) proving who signed a message and that it wasn’t altered.

Key Exchange

Definition: Methods to securely agree on keys between parties (e.g., Diffie-Hellman, ECDH).

Salting (for passwords)

Definition: Adding random data to a password before hashing so identical passwords do not yield the same hash and to slow down precomputed attacks.

Steganography

Definition: Hiding a message inside another file (image, audio, etc.) so the message's existence is concealed.

One-Time Pad (OTP)

Definition: A theoretically unbreakable method when a truly random key as long as the message is used once and kept secret.
