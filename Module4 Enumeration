MODULE 4. ENUMERATION 

* Enumeration : Enumeration involves an attacker creating active connections with a target system and performing directed queries to gain more information about the target usernames, machine names, network resources, shares, and services from a system or network.


1) NETBIOS :NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System) is a protocol that allows computers to communicate over a local area network (LAN).  
 - **Name Resolution:** Translates computer names to IP addresses.
- **Resource Sharing:** Facilitates file and printer sharing.
- **Compatibility:** Supports older systems and applications.

### Ports Used by NetBIOS

- **UDP 137:** Name Service
- **UDP 138:** Datagram Service
- **TCP 139:** Session Service

The primary command for working with NetBIOS over TCP/IP in Windows is nbtstat. nbtstat -A <IP address> on linux nbtscan 192.168.1.0/24 These commands allow you to gather and display NetBIOS information on Windows and Kali Linux systems.


2) What is SNMP?
SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) is like a way for computers and network devices (like routers and switches) to talk to each other and share important information.

### Ports Used by SNMP

- **UDP 161:** For asking questions.
- **UDP 162:** For sending alerts.

### How SNMP Works

**Components:**
   - **Manager:** Like a teacher asking questions.
   - **Agent:** Like a student answering the teacher.

**Process:**
   - The **manager** (teacher) asks the **agent** (student) a question using UDP port 161. For example, "What's your current temperature?"
   - The **agent** (student) answers back with the temperature.
   - If something important happens, the **agent** (student) sends an alert to the **manager** (teacher) using UDP port 162, like saying, "The temperature is too high!"  3) What is LDAP?

3)LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) is a protocol used to access and manage directory information services, like a phone book for network resources and users.

### Port Used by LDAP

- **TCP 389:** For standard LDAP communication.
- **TCP 636:** For secure LDAP (LDAPS) communication.

### How LDAP Works

 **Components:**
   - **Client:** Asks for information.
   - **Server:** Stores and provides the information.

 **Process:**
   - The **client** sends a request to the **server** on port 389 (or 636 for secure communication).
   - The **server** looks up the requested information in the directory.
   - The **server** sends the information back to the **client**.

### Example

1. **Client:** A user logs into their computer and needs to authenticate.
2. **Request:** The computer (client) sends a request to the LDAP server: "Is this username and password correct?"
3. **Response:** The LDAP server checks its directory and responds: "Yes, the credentials are correct."
4. **Access:** The user is granted access to the system.

LDAP is used to manage and authenticate user access to various resources within a network, making it easier to keep everything organised and secure.


4) What is NTP?
NTP (Network Time Protocol) is used to synchronise the clocks of computers over a network.

**Port Used:** UDP 123

**Example:**
- Your computer asks an NTP server: "What time is it?"
- The NTP server responds with the current time.
- Your computer adjusts its clock to match the server's time.

5) What is NFS?
NFS (Network File System) allows computers to share files over a network as if they were on the local disk.
 
**Ports Used:** TCP/UDP 2049

**Example:**
- A client computer accesses a file stored on an NFS server.
- The file appears and behaves as if it were on the client's local hard drive, allowing easy file sharing and access.

These protocols help keep time accurate across systems (NTP) and enable file sharing over networks (NFS).


6) What is SMTP?
SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is used to send emails.

**Ports Used:** TCP 25, 465 (secure), 587 (secure)

**Example:**
- Your email client sends an email to the SMTP server on port 25.
- The SMTP server forwards the email to the recipient's email server.


7) What is DNS?
DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses.

**Ports Used:** UDP 53, TCP 53

**Example:**
- You type `www.example.com` in your browser.
- The browser queries a DNS server on port 53.
- The DNS server responds with the IP address for `www.example.com`.
