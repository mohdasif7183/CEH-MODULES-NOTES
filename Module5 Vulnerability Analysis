MODULE 5 : VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS 
 
* Vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by attackers.

Common reasons for vulnerabilities:
1. Hardware or software misconfiguration.
2. Insecure or poor design of networks and apps.
3. Careless user behaviour.
4. Inherent technology weaknesses.


Technological Vulnerabilities : 
TCP/IP protocol vulnerabilities : HTTP, FTP, ICMP, SNMP, SMTP are inherently insecure.
Operating System vulnerabilities :  An OS can be vulnerable because: o It is inherently insecure o It is not patched with the latest updates
Network Device Vulnerabilities :Various network devices such as routers, firewall, and switches can be vulnerable due to: o Lack of password protection o Lack of authentication o Insecure routing protocols o Firewall vulnerabilities

Configuration Vulnerabilities :
 1. User account vulnerabilities
 2. System account vulnerabilities 
 3. Internet service misconfiguration 
 4. Default password and settings 
 5.Network device misconfiguration


* Vulnerability Research is the process of finding and studying security weaknesses in systems, software, or networks to understand how they can be exploited and to help fix them before attackers do. Vulnerabilities are classified based on severity level (low, medium, or high) and exploit range (local or remote)
 
* Vulnerability Assessment is the process of identifying, analysing, and evaluating security weaknesses in systems, networks, or software to determine potential risks and prioritise fixing them.
Vulnerability Scoring Systems** and **Databases** help assess the severity of vulnerabilities and track known issues. Key ones include:

1. **CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)**: Rates the severity of vulnerabilities from 0 to 10.
2. **CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)**: A database that lists known vulnerabilities.
3. **NVD (National Vulnerability Database)**: A U.S. government database that includes CVE entries with added details like severity scores.
4. **CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration)**:  is a list of common software and hardware weaknesses that can cause security issues. It helps prevent vulnerabilities.

CVSS Severity Ratings:
Low (Score: 0.1 - 3.9):
Description: Vulnerabilities that pose a minimal risk to systems. These typically require a lot of effort to exploit and cause limited harm or impact.
Example: A vulnerability with little or no potential for exploitation.
Medium (Score: 4.0 - 6.9):
Description: Vulnerabilities that pose a moderate risk. Exploitation is possible, but not easy or immediate. It could cause some impact, but is often limited.
Example: An issue that could be exploited if certain conditions are met (e.g., specific software version).
High (Score: 7.0 - 8.9):
Description: Vulnerabilities that pose a significant risk. These are relatively easy to exploit and can cause serious impact, such as system compromise or data loss.
Example: A vulnerability that can be exploited remotely with minimal user interaction.
Critical (Score: 9.0 - 10.0):
Description: Vulnerabilities that pose a severe risk. These are often easy to exploit, can cause extensive damage, and require immediate attention.
Example: A vulnerability that allows remote code execution or total system compromise without user interaction.
Summary of Scores:
Low: 0.1 - 3.9
Medium: 4.0 - 6.9
High: 7.0 - 8.9
Critical: 9.0 - 10.0


 * Vulnerability Management Life Cycle:  is a process to identify, assess, fix, and monitor vulnerabilities in a system.

1. **Pre-assessment phase**: Prepare by setting goals, identifying assets, and gathering information.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment phase**: Scan systems for vulnerabilities and analyse them.
3. **Post-assessment phase**: Fix vulnerabilities, monitor for new risks, and improve security.

How it works : 
- Identify weaknesses.
- Assess the risk.
- Remediate (fix) issues â€¨- Verification. 
- Monitor for future vulnerabilities.


**Types of Vulnerability Assessments**:

1. **Active Assessment**: Actively scans and interacts with systems to find vulnerabilities.
2. **Passive Assessment**: Monitors network traffic without directly interacting with systems.
3. **External Assessment**: Scans external-facing systems like websites.
4. **Internal Assessment**: Examines internal systems within the network.
5. **Host-based Assessment**: Analyzes vulnerabilities on individual devices or servers.
6. **Network-based Assessment**: Scans the entire network for vulnerabilities.
7. **Application Assessment**: Focuses on finding flaws in software applications.

Additional **Types of Vulnerability Assessments**:

1. **Database Assessment**: Identifies vulnerabilities in databases.
2. **Wireless Network Assessment**: Scans wireless networks for security risks.
3. **Distributed Assessment**: Assesses multiple systems across different locations.
4. **Credentialed Assessment**: Uses valid credentials for deeper system checks.
5. **Non-Credentialed Assessment**: Scans systems without user credentials.
6. **Manual Assessment**: Involves human analysis to find vulnerabilities.
7. **Automated Assessment**: Uses tools to automatically detect vulnerabilities.


* Vulnerability Assessment Tools:  1. Qualys Vulnerability Management 2. Nessus Professional 3. GFI LanGuard 4. OpenVAS and 5. Nikto 

*Vulnerability Assessment Reports:  summarise the findings from a vulnerability assessment, providing details and recommendations.

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level overview of the assessment, key findings, and recommendations for senior management.
2. **Assessment Overview**: Description of the scope, methods, and tools used during the assessment.
3. **Findings**: Detailed list of identified vulnerabilities and issues.
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluation of the potential impact and likelihood of each vulnerability.
5. **Recommendations**: Suggested actions to address and remediate identified vulnerabilities.
