MODULE 10 DENIAL-OF-SERVICE

* What is a DoS Attack?
A DoS attack is when attackers overload a system to make it unavailable to users.

* What is a DDoS Attack? 
A DDoS attack is when multiple systems flood a target to crash or slow it down, causing a service outage

* what are Botnets ?
Botnets are networks of infected computers controlled remotely to launch large-scale attacks, like DDoS


* Basic Categories of DoS/DDoS Attack Vectors?
Volumetric Attacks: Overwhelm bandwidth with massive traffic.
Protocol Attacks: Exploit network protocols to exhaust resources.
Application Layer Attacks: Target application-specific functions to disrupt services


* what is UDP Flood Attack ?
A UDP flood attack sends large volumes of UDP packets to overload a target’s network, causing a slowdown or crash.

* what is ICMP Flood Attack ?
An ICMP flood attack overwhelms a target by sending numerous ICMP (ping) requests, exhausting its resources and causing downtime.


* what is Ping of Death and Smurf Attacks ?
Ping of Death: Sends oversized ping packets to crash or freeze a target.
Smurf Attack: Spoofs IP and broadcasts ICMP requests, causing network overload by amplifying responses.


* what is Pulse Wave and Zero-Day DDoS Attacks ?
Pulse Wave: Rapid, high-intensity bursts of traffic to exhaust defenses.
Zero-Day DDoS: Exploits unknown vulnerabilities for an unexpected, hard-to-defend attack.


* what is SYN Flood Attack ?
An SYN flood attack sends many SYN requests to a server but never completes the handshake, overloading and freezing the server.


* what is Fragmentation Attack ?
A fragmentation attack splits malicious packets into smaller pieces to evade detection and disrupt a target’s network by overwhelming its ability to reassemble them.


* what is Spoofed Session Flood Attack?
A spoofed session flood attack sends fake session requests to a server, consuming resources and causing legitimate connections to fail.


* what is HTTP GET/POST and Slowloris Attacks ?
HTTP GET/POST Attack: Overloads a server by sending numerous GET or POST requests to exhaust resources.
Slowloris Attack: Maintains many connections to a server by sending partial HTTP requests, keeping them open to consume server resources slowly.


* what is Multi-Vector Attack ?
A multi-vector attack combines different types of attacks, such as volumetric, protocol, and application layer attacks, to overwhelm and disrupt a target simultaneously.   * what is Peer-to-Peer Attack ?
A peer-to-peer attack uses multiple interconnected devices to launch coordinated attacks on a target, leveraging their combined bandwidth and resources.   * Permanent Denial-of-Service Attack and TCP SACK Panic Attack  ? 
Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) Attack: Permanently damages a system or service, making recovery difficult or impossible.
TCP SACK Panic Attack: Exploits the TCP Selective Acknowledgment (SACK) feature to overwhelm a target, causing it to crash or hang.


* what is Distributed Reflection Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) Attack ?
A Distributed Reflection Denial-of-Service (DRDoS) attack uses multiple compromised systems to send amplified responses to a target, overwhelming it with traffic.   * what is DDoS Extortion/Ransom DDoS (RDDoS) Attack ?
A DDoS extortion or Ransom DDoS (RDDoS) attack threatens to launch a DDoS attack unless a ransom is paid, aiming to intimidate and coerce the target.


* DoS/DDoS Attack Tools ?
▪ XOIC (http://anonhacktivism.blogspot.com) ▪ HULK (https://github.com) ▪ Metasploit (https://www.metasploit.com) ▪ Tor’s Hammer (https://sourceforge.net) ▪ Slowloris (https://github.com) ▪ PyLoris (https://sourceforge.net)

* what are the DoS/DDoS Countermeasure Strategies ?
Absorbing the Attack : Use additional capacity to absorb the attack Requires preplanning and additional resources
Degrading Services : Identify critical services to maintain functionality while stopping non-critical services
Shutting Down the Services : Shut down all services until the attack has subsided
